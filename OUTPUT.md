# Code Refinement Assessment - Changes Made

## Project Setup & Code Quality

- Fixed build errors and configured `Prettier` for consistent code formatting
- Added `Husky` pre-commit hooks for automatic linting and formatting checks
- Cleaned up unused dependencies and files
- Refactored to `absolute imports` for better maintainability
- Added page-specific file and folder structure for better organization

## Component Development

- Broke down each UI section into its own component (`header`, `logo`, `user-avatar`, `body`, `tag-list`)  for better maintainability  
- Created reusable `SearchBar` component with `variants`, `JSDoc` documentation, `useSearchBarValues` hook, and proper TypeScript interfaces

## Accessibility Implementation

- **Semantic HTML**: Added proper landmarks (`main`, `section`, `nav`) and heading hierarchy
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Made all interactive elements `focusable` with white focus rings for dark theme
- **Screen Reader Support**: Added ARIA labels, roles, and proper form semantics

## Component-Specific Changes

- **Logo**: Converted to button with keyboard focus and scroll-to-top functionality
- **User Avatar**: Made keyboard accessible with proper ARIA labeling
- **Search Components**: Added form structure, search roles, and proper event handling
- **Tag Lists**: Implemented semantic list structure with keyboard navigation

## Technical Decisions

- Used separate branches for changes and improvements to maintain clean development workflow
- Maintained strict TypeScript typing while buidling components adding accessibility features
- Added css variables for reusable colors from design
- Chose white focus indicators for optimal contrast on dark background

**Result**: Transformed static UI into fully responsive, accessible, keyboard-navigable interface.
